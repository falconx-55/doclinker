## Prerequisites

Before installing doclinker, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

| Dependency   | Version | Installation Command           |
| :----------- | :------ | :----------------------------- |
| Node.js      | 16+     | `nvm install 16` or `brew install node` |
| npm          | 7+      | `npm install -g npm@latest`    |
| MongoDB      | 5.0+    | [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)     |
| Python       | 3.8+    | [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)     |

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

bash
    npm start
    | Variable             | Description                                     | Example                         |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `PORT`               | The port on which the server will run.          | `3000`                          |
| `MONGODB_URI`        | The URI for connecting to the MongoDB database. | `mongodb://localhost:27017/doclinker` |
| `JWT_SECRET`         | Secret key for JWT authentication.            | `your-secret-key`               |
| `API_KEY`        | API Key for accessing external services.            | `your-api-key`               |

Example `.env` file:

bash
    npm start
    ### Advanced Usage

1.  **User Authentication:**
    > Implement user authentication to secure your API endpoints.
2.  **Data Validation:**
    > Implement request body validation to ensure data integrity.

Example API request using `curl`:

json
    [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Dr. John Doe",
            "specialization": "Cardiologist"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
            "specialization": "Dermatologist"
        }
    ]
    json
    {
        "id": "101",
        "doctorId": "1",
        "patientId": "123",
        "date": "2024-01-01",
        "time": "10:00"
    }
    -   **Problem:** Application fails to start.
    > **Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and that the MongoDB server is running. Check the `.env` file for any misconfigurations.
-   **Problem:** API requests return errors.
    > **Solution:** Verify the API endpoints and request parameters. Check the server logs for detailed error messages.

## Performance Considerations

-   **Database Optimization:**
    > Ensure proper indexing and query optimization for efficient data retrieval.
-   **Caching:**
    > Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Security Notes

-   **Data Encryption:**
    > Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
-   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    > Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect API endpoints.
-   **Input Validation:**
    > Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Roadmap

-   **Integration with third-party EHR systems.**
-   **Implementation of advanced search filters.**
-   **Development of a mobile app (iOS and Android).**
-   **AI-driven diagnosis suggestions.**
